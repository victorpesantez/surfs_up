***Feasibility of Surf shop in Oahu.

*****Overview.
******Weather Patterns to Dictate Business Viability.

The purpose of this analysis is to establish if opening a business year-round in Oahu is sustainable based on weather patterns. If the weather shows significant dips in average temperature in either month, it will be assumed that tourism will suffer making the business unsustainable. 


*****Results
*****Similar Temperatures for Months of June and December
Though the results of the output for the the month of June years 2010 - 2017 does not greatly differ from the output for the month of December years 2010 - 2017, December overall is slightly colder.  
     -On average, each day is 3.90 degrees colder in December than June, however in both cases the average temperature is still considered beach weather being above 71       degrees. 
     -Both maintain a relatively similar standard deviation in regards to temperature (3.26 in June vs 3.75 in December), so the temperature does remain relatively       stable. 
     -It is notable that despite the relative simularities, the minimum temperature in December tends to be 8 full degrees colder in December at 56 degrees in which       not many tourists will want to spend time on the beach.  
     -Both monthly outputs do have similar hottest temperatures of 85 degrees max temp in June versus 83 degrees max temp in December.


*****Summary 
*****Stable Surfing Weather Year-Round
The difference in temperature between the months of June and December are minimal from a surfing perspective.  There will be a few days each December where tourism and thus sales will suffer due to the coldest days being in the mid fifties, but most days are above seventy degrees which will continue to attract locals, tourists, and surfing enthusiasts to the beach.  The surf shop Business in Oahu will be feasible, based on the temperature data.  Before formally making this recommendation, further investigation should be made into reviewing humidity and severe storm data such as wind speed and occurence of lightning to account for other weather-related factors that would further prevent potential customers from coming to this store beach location.
